# YMCA Database System

This project offers a complete MySQL database setup for the YMCA, starting with the Entity-Relationship model and extending through SQL scripts that define the schema, load example data, and showcase typical query operations. Created as the final project for a Database Management Systems course, I played a major role in shaping the ER diagram and writing all of the SQL scripts.

## Getting Started

To initialize the database, supply your MySQL user name and the target database, then execute the scripts in sequence. For instance:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < create.sql
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < insert.sql
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < query.sql
